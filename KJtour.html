            <p>In terms of pure convenience, no continent can touch Europe’s diversity. With so many countries, cultures, languages, and varieties of cuisine packed into such a comparatively tiny place, you can spend a week in Europe and experience something wildly different every day.</p>

            <p>Its name means “sunny place” in the Berber tongue, but “Africa” may as well be a synonym for “vastness.” A truly massive continent comprising over 20% of the planet’s available land, Africa is home to the world’s largest desert, its longest river, its hottest temperatures, and hundreds of dialects and cultures spread among a billion people.</p>

     <h2>COVID-19 assessment for travel</h2>
     <h3>Private pay testing for travel</h3>
     <p>There are some private pay clinics that offer testing for a fee to people who require asymptomatic testing for reasons that fall outside of B.C. public health recommendations, as outlined in the testing guidelines, such as for travel or employment. For a listing of private pay clinics, please visit the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) website.

        Please contact these clinics directly to learn more and to arrange for this testing. Please note that public clinics do not offer this type of testing. </p>
     <h3>Non-testing options for travel</h3>
        <p>If you do not have any symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and require a consultation or documentation for travel outside of Canada, please call a primary care provider. 
        
            VCH COVID-19 collection and assessment centres CANNOT provide assessment, testing or other documentation for travel (this includes Urgent Primary Care Centres). COVID-19 testing is not recommended for individuals without symptoms.</p>
    <h3>Primary care provider</h3>
    <p>A primary care provider (family doctor or nurse practitioner) can offer a COVID-19 clearance letter. Please visit your primary care provider or a walk-in clinic.</p>

        from Colombia and he is 18 years old. <br/>Very young but with big ideas.
        <br/>He knows Japanese but you should avoid talk with him because he only
        knows bad words.<br>The other one is Kose, He is from Japan, Hokkaido to
        be specific.
